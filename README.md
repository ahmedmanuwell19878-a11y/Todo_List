## Todo List Application ✅

A responsive Todo List web application built using **React.js** and **Bootstrap**, featuring a secure and user-friendly **login page implemented with React Hook Form**.  
The app allows users to add, view, and manage their daily tasks efficiently while demonstrating modern React practices such as component-based architecture, form validation, and state management.

This project highlights my ability to build interactive UIs, handle form validation cleanly, and create responsive layouts suitable for real-world applications.
